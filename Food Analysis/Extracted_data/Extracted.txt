Fish, in Bangladesh where malnutrition remains a significant development challenge, is an irreplaceable
animal-source food in the diet of millions. However, existing data on the nutrient composition of fish do
not reflect the large diversity available and have focused on only a few select nutrients. The purpose of
this study was to fill the gaps in existing data on the nutrient profiles of common fish in Bangladesh by
analysing the proximate, vitamin, mineral and fatty acid composition of 55 fish, shrimp and prawn
species from inland capture, aquaculture and marine capture fisheries. When comparing species, the
composition of nutrients of public health significance was diverse. Iron ranged from 0.34 to 19 mg/100 g,
zinc from 0.6 to 4.7 mg/100 g, calcium from 8.6 to 1900 mg/100 g, vitamin A from 0 to 2503 jg/100 g
and vitamin B12 from 0.50 to 14 j1g/100 g. Several species were rich in essential fatty acids, particularly

fisheries (Belton and Thilsted, 2014).

In Bangladesh, fish is an irreplaceable animal-source food in the
diet of millions, both in terms of quantity - accounting for
approximately 60% of animal protein intake at 18.1 kg consumed
per person per year - and frequency of consumption, far exceeding
that of any other animal-source food (Belton et al., 2014). The
country possesses diverse and abundant aquatic resources with
267 freshwater fish species (Thilsted, 2010), and an annual
production of 3.1 million tonnes (Belton and Thilsted, 2014).
Bangladesh is also one of many developing countries to experience
the proliferation of aquaculture, now the world’s fastest growing

While remaining largely successful in increasing supply to meet
the demand of a growing population, the extent to which the
growth of aquaculture has been able to mitigate reduction in
dietary diversity and micronutrient intake from the diverse but
waning capture fisheries sector, focusing on only a few select large
species, is questionable (Belton et al., 2014). Despite improvement
in some food and nutrition security indicators (JPGSPH and HKI,
2012), malnutrition, largely caused by inadequate micronutrient
intake, remains widespread with 41% of children under five years
suffering from stunted growth (NIPORT et al., 2013). The fisheries
and aquaculture sector has been recognised as a key resource in
tackling food and nutrition security issues and features promi-
nently in the national development agenda (Government of the
Peoples Republic of Bangladesh, 2005a,b, 2006, 2011).

Knowledge of the nutrient composition of important foods is
an invaluable tool in understanding the links between food

production, access and nutrient intakes, and in devising policies
and programmes such as development of improved production
technologies (Thilsted and Wahab, 2014a), to ensure that food
supply optimally fulfils population nutrient requirements. How-
ever, despite the clear importance of fish in the Bangladeshi diet,
existing composition data do not reflect the large diversity of
species available for consumption and have only focused on a few
select nutrients rather than comprehensive nutrient profiles. The
recently published Food Composition Table for Bangladesh is a
useful compilation of existing composition data on important
foods (including a number of fish and fish products); however, the
data come from a large number of sources including regional
databases with varying sampling and analytical methods, some of
which are now several decades old (INFS, 2013).

The primary objective of this study was to document
comprehensive nutrient composition profiles of important fish,
shrimp and prawn species in Bangladesh with a specific focus on
small indigenous species (SIS). Species and nutrient components
selected for analyses were chosen to ‘fill the gaps’ in existing data
(Roos et al., 2002), using rigorous sampling and analytical
methods, as well as to extend the data to include more species
diversity. The secondary objective was to estimate the potential
contribution of fish, shrimp and prawn species to recommended
nutrient intakes (RNIs) during the first 1000 days of life, which
means for women throughout pregnancy and lactation, and for
infants from age 7 to 23 months. Specific nutrients considered are
iron, zinc, calcium, iodine, vitamin A and vitamin B12, which are of
known public health concern in Bangladesh (Craviari et al., 2008;
Fischer et al., 1999; ICDDRB et al., 2013). Data presented in this
paper are the most comprehensive collection on the nutrient
composition of important fish, shrimp and prawn species in
Bangladesh, both in terms of the number of species and the
nutrient components analysed, to date.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Sampling protocol

The sampling method was constrained by the nature of rural
fish markets in this context, largely dependent on the activities of
small-scale fishermen whose supply is unpredictable. As a result,
single pooled samples of 54 fish, shrimp and prawn species
commonly available during the monsoon season, were collected at
local markets and fish landing sites in Mymensingh, Sylhet, Khulna
and Cox’s Bazar districts in Bangladesh as shown in Fig. 1, from
July-September 2012. Additionally, one small fish species (Ambly-
pharyngodon mola) was sampled both from the market (assumed to
be from an inland capture source) and from a homestead pond in
Dinajpur district (referred to as Molaccytturea)). The number of fish
collected for each sample was dependent on the average size of
each fish species but was a total of approximately two kilograms
for each sample. For small fish species (<500 g per fish), a single
pooled sample of up to several hundred individual fish (to make a
total sample of approximately two kilograms) was collected, for
medium fish (500-750 g per fish), a single pooled sample of four
individual fish, and for larger fish (>750 g per fish), a single pooled
sample of two individual fish. Samples were packed in polyeth-
ylene bags at the collection site and transported in an insulated ice
box lined with ice chips and away from direct sunlight, to a nearby
laboratory facility.

2.2. Sample preparation

The identification details of each sample including common
Bangla name, scientific name, location of sample collection and
sample preparation details are shown in Table 1. In this paper,

samples are referred to by the common Bangla name and are
grouped according to the three dominant fish production sectors:
inland capture, inland aquaculture and marine capture fisheries.
Samples were cleaned by local fisher-folk to obtain raw, edible
parts according to traditional practice. Depending on the fish
species, edible parts may or may not include the head, viscera,
scales, bones and other parts (Table 1). To avoid contamination of
samples, non-metal equipment such as plastic cutting boards,
buckets and strainers, and ceramic cutting knives were used to
obtain raw edible parts. Fish samples were washed with deionised
water after cleaning and before being packed in polyethylene bags
and stored in a deep freezer at —18 °C. Frozen samples were
transported in an insulated box, lined with dry ice to laboratories in
New Zealand and Denmark for nutrient composition analysis. The
temperature of fish samples was measured upon receipt at the
testing facilities to ensure that the samples had remained frozen
during transportation. Fish species were homogenised as per raw
edible parts prior to analysis and subsamples of the homogenate
were taken, with size appropriate for individual analytical tests
(10-100 g). For several species, the homogenate included bones,
and for others, bones were removed prior to homogenisation if
they are typically discarded as plate waste, as shown in Table 1.

2.3. Analytical methods

The analytical methods for each nutrient component, and
corresponding limits of quantitation (LOQ) and reproducibility are
summarised in Table 2.

vitamin A activity included all-trans-retinol, 13-cis-retinol, all-
trans-3,4-dehydroretinol and 13-cis-3,4-dehydroretinol. Dehy-
droretinol is expected to demonstrate 40% of the biological
activity of retinol (Shantz and Brinkman, 1950) and possibly up
to 110% (Riabroy and Anumihardjo, 2011). For vitamin D, the CEN-
method was modified to include quantitation of 25-hydroxy
vitamin D3 (Jakobsen et al., 2007). Vitamin B12 was determined by
microbiological assay using Lactobacillus delbrueckii as the test
organism (Nord, 1960), and folate was determined using Lactoba-
cillus casei as the test organism (CEN, 2003).

2.4, Presentation of results

All proximate components and minerals were analysed in
duplicate and presented here as the mean, reported to the same
number of significant figures as per original analytical results. For
some samples a result of ‘none detected’ is given when a
quantifiable result was found for one replicate but the
corresponding duplicate returned a result below the LOQ. All
minerals (except sulphur) were reported in metric units per kg of
raw, edible parts but are presented here as metric units per 100 g
raw, edible parts for ease of use. Energy was calculated using
Atwater factors from assayed proximate components (Merill and
Watt, 1973). Due to resource limitations, vitamins and fatty acids

were analysed singly and presented here as per analytical results.
Vitamin A components are presented as yg/100g of 13-cis-
retinol, 13-cis-3,4-dehydroretinol, all-trans-retinol, all-trans-3,4-
dehydroretinol and B-carotene and then total vitamin A in
retinol activity equivalents (jg RAE/100 g) has been calculated
according to the following conversion factors: 1 wg all-trans-
retinol = 1 wg RAE, 1 wg 13-cis-retinol = 0.75 wg RAE (Ames et al.,
1955), 1 wg all-trans-3,4-dehydroretinol = 0.4 wg RAE, 1 wg 13-
cis-3,4-dehydroretinol = 0.4 wg RAE (Shantz and Brinkman,
1950), 1 wg B-carotene = 0.08 wg RAE (Ottin et al., 2006). Species
analysed for vitamin D and E at AsureQuality were reported in
International Units per 100 g of raw edible parts (IU/100 g) and
were converted to International System of Units (SI) units (wg/
100 g) using the following conversion factors: vitamin D2 (yg/
100 g)=vitamin D2 (IU/100g) x 0.025, vitamin D3 (pg/
100 g) = vitamin D3 (IU/100 g) x 0.025 and vitamin E(tocopherol)
(mg/100g)=vitamin — E¢tocopherot) (IU/100g) x 0.67 (FAO/
INFOODS, 2012). Fatty acid components are presented here as
per analytical results and total n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids
(PUFA) and n-3 PUFA were calculated from the fatty acid profile.
All results are presented as per 100g raw, edible parts. The
composition of nutrients of public health significance, vitamins
and fatty acids, in relation to RNI’s have been discussed in the
results section.

fat is stored in particular species but may also be affected by
seasonal/lifecycle variations and the diet/food availability of the
species at the time of sampling (Ababouch, 2005). For example,
bottom dwelling species such as the indigenous major carps are

typically lean fish, storing fat in the liver (Ababouch, 2005),
whereas, migratory fish such as Ilish have a higher content of dark
muscle which tends to be rich in fat (Alam et al., 2012). The
moisture content of fish species ranged from 60.2 to 85.4 g/100g
and, as expected was negatively correlated with fat and energy
content (correlation coefficient of —0.91 and —0.95 respectively).
Ash content ranged from 0.7 to 5.3 g/100g and is positively
correlated with mineral content, particularly calcium, phosphorus,
magnesium and zinc, with correlation coefficients of 0.98, 0.95,
0.85, and 0.74 respectively. The large variation in ash content is
likely related to inclusion of bones as edible parts in some species,
which would lead to higher ash content in these.

3.2. Mineral composition

The iron, zinc, calcium, iodine, selenium, phosphorus, magne-
sium, sodium, potassium, manganese, sulphur and copper
composition for all species are shown in Table 4.

3.2.1. Iron

Iron content varied considerably with a range from 0.34 to
19 mg/100 g and a mean value of 2.6 mg/100 g. Three species of
fish and one species of prawn were identified that would meet
>25% of the RNI for PLW and infants: Chapila, Darkina, Mola and
Najari Icha (Table 5). These results show a greater range in iron
content compared to a values reported in the global FAO/INFOODS
database on fish and shellfish (excluding molluscs) (FAO/INFOODS,
2013). Of interest is that iron content of cultured Mola (19 mg/
100 g) is much higher than previously reported values for capture
Mola (5.7 mg/100 g). This may be partly attributable to sampling
variability, methodological differences in analysis of iron content,
or may reflect real differences in the accumulation of iron in this
species based on differing environmental conditions. The true
nature and magnitude of these differences should be further
investigated. Overall, the data presented here indicate that several
species (all from inland capture fisheries) may contribute
significantly to dietary iron intakes in Bangladesh which is of
high bioavailability as an animal-source food (FAO and WHO,
2004). This may have important policy implications given the
public health significance of iron deficiency in Bangladesh, with
prevalence recently estimated at 10.7% in preschool aged children
and 7.1% in adult women (ICDDRB et al., 2013), and the well
documented negative effects of deficiency on physical and
cognitive development, pregnancy outcomes, morbidity and
mortality.

3.2.2. Zinc

Zinc concentration varied considerably from 0.6 to 4.7 mg/
100 g with a mean content of 1.9 mg/100 g. These results are
within the range of fish and seafood reported elsewhere (FAO/
INFOODS, 2013). Four species were identified that would meet
>25% of the RNI for PLW; Chela, Darkina, cultured Mola and Rani,
and two species: Chela and cultured Mola, which would meet
>25% of the RNI for infants, from a standard portion (Table 5). A
further seven species of fish and one species of prawn (all of
which are capture species) would meet 20-25% of RNIs for PLW
(Dhela, Ekthute, Kachki, Kata Phasa, Mola, Najari Icha, Tengra,
and Tit Punti) and a further six species of fish and one species of
prawn would meet 20-25% of RNIs for infants (Darkina, Dhela,
Ekthute, Mola, Najari Icha, Rani and Tit Punti). In light of recent
estimates of a national prevalence of zinc deficiency in 57.3% of
women and 44.6% of pre-school aged children in Bangladesh
(ICDDRB et al., 2013), several SIS and prawn species could
contribute significantly to dietary zinc intake, also taking into
consideration that zinc in animal-source foods is highly
bioavailable (FAO and WHO, 2004).

3.2.3. Calcium

Calcium content ranged considerably from 8.6 to 1900 mg/
100 g with a mean content of 600 mg/100 g. These results are
within the range of fish and seafood reported elsewhere (FAO/
INFOODS, 2013). As would be expected, calcium content was much
higher in species in which bones are commonly consumed and
included in the edible parts. Fourteen species were identified that
would meet >50% of the RNI for PLW, and 18 species that would
meet >50% of the RNI for infants (Table 5). Calcium deficiency
nationally has not been evaluated, however, it has been implicated
in the development of rickets, estimated to affect 550,000 children
in 2008 (Craviari et al., 2008; Fischer et al., 1999; ICDDRB, 2009),
and in a study in two rural subdistricts of Bangladesh, it was
estimated no women or young children had diets adequate in
calcium, attributable to low food intake and low dietary diversity
(Arsenault et al., 2013). In developed countries, dairy products tend
to be the primary source of dietary calcium; however, this is not
the case in Bangladesh where frequency of dairy consumption is
very low (Belton et al., 2014; JPGSPH and HKI, 2012). The data
presented here further support the conclusion that in Bangladesh,
SIS eaten whole, with bones are a significant source of highly
bioavailable dietary calcium (Larsen et al., 2000; Roos et al.,
2007a,b).

3.2.4. Iodine

Iodine was below detectable limits in eight of the 55 species,
and ranged up to 120 jg/100 g, with a mean of 22 jrg/100 g. Only
one species of prawn (Najari Icha) would contribute to >25% of the
RNI, and one species of fish (Darkina) would contribute >20% of the
RNI, for PLW and infants (Table 5). The iodine content of foods
tends to be largely dependent on environmental conditions.
Marine fish and seafood tend to be rich dietary sources with amean
composition of 83 1g/100g in marine fish reported elsewhere
(FAO/WHO, 2004); however, this was not particularly evident in
the marine species analysed here, with a range of only 6.9-41 jg/
100 g. This is the first study in which the iodine content of fish,
shrimp and prawn in Bangladesh was analysed. The composition of
iodine in inland capture species reported here was within the
range of fish and seafood reported elsewhere (FAO/INFOODS,
2013), but most species are unlikely to be a significant source of
dietary iodine.

3.2.5. Selenium, phosphorus, magnesium, sodium, potassium,
manganese, sulphur, copper and chromium

The contents of these minerals were analysed for data
completeness but they are not associated with significant public
health concerns currently, and therefore, their nutritional signifi-
cance is not discussed here. Selenium content of foods varies
significantly according to surrounding environmental conditions.
The selenium content in species analysed here showed a wide
range from 5 to 110 yg/100g, consistent with data reported
elsewhere (FAO/INFOODS, 2013). Phosphorus content ranged from
110 to 1000 mg/100 g, with higher composition in fish species with
bones included in edible parts, also consistent with values reported
elsewhere (FAO/INFOODS, 2013). The ranges of magnesium (21-
57 mg/100 g), sodium (26-110 mg/100g) and potassium (58-
350 mg/100 g) content were broadly consistent with ranges for
other fish and seafood reported elsewhere (FAO/INFOODS, 2013).
Manganese content ranged from 0.010 to 2.8 mg/100g and is
higher than results reported elsewhere (FAO/INFOODS, 2013),
which may be related to water pollution (Tornqvist et al., 2011).
Sulphur content ranged from 160 to 300 mg/100 g and is higher
than results reported in the FAO/INFOODS global database,
although consistent with results reported elsewhere in the
literature (Vlieg et al., 1991). Copper content ranged from 0 to
1.2 mg/100 g with highest values found in shrimp and prawn, far

exceeding that in fish species, with 0.49 and 1.2 mg/100 g found in
Harina Chingri and Najari Icha, respectively; although largely
consistent with results reported for fish and seafood elsewhere
(FAO/INFOODS, 2013). Chromium was undetectable in almost all
species, with the exception of cultured Mola and Najari Icha which
had very low concentrations of 0.027 and 0.022 mg/100g,
respectively, also consistent with data reported elsewhere (FAO/
INFOODS, 2013).

3.3. Vitamin composition

The vitamin A, B12, D, E and folate composition of fish and
shrimp species is shown in Table 6.

3.3.1. Vitamin A

In addition to vitamin A content of 20 species originally
presented by Roos (2001), data on a further 28 species (and
cultured Mola) are presented in Table 6. Total vitamin A was
undetected in 11 species and ranged up to 2503 wg RAE/100 g. As
expected, cultured Mola fish had significant concentrations of
retinol and dehydroretinol as had been identified previously in
capture Mola (Roos, 2001). Three species (all SIS): Mola, Dhela and
Darkina were identified that could potentially contribute >25% of
RNI for PLW and infants in a standard portion. The data presented
here support previous studies in Bangladesh which have identified
that some SIS such as Mola have potential to play a significant role
in food-based strategies to address vitamin A deficiency (Roos
et al., 2007a).

3.3.2. Vitamin B12

The vitamin B12 content in fish species ranged from 0.50 to
14 wg/100 g (n = 49). The highest concentration, 14 j1g/100 g, was
found in Majhari Thai Pangas (juvenile Thai Pangas), however, this
was not maintained in the adult Thai Pangas with a concentration
of only 1.5 j1g/100 g. Very limited data on vitamin B12 in fish and
seafood are available for comparison in the literature. In the
Australian food composition database, vitamin B12 content of fish
and seafood ranges from 0.2 to 15.2 g/100 g which is consistent
with results reported here (FSANZ, 2010). For PLW and infants, 13
and 21 species respectively, were identified that would potentially
contribute >100% of the daily RNI in a standard portion. Care
should be taken however, when comparing results of vitamin B12
in species analysed by different laboratories due to differences in
analytical methods. This is the first analysis of vitamin B12
composition of fish species in Bangladesh, and is of particular
public health significance given the recent estimate of a national
prevalence of vitamin B12 deficiency in 22% of adult women and
the clear negative implications of deficiency on cognitive
development and function (de Benoist, 2008). As dietary sources
of vitamin B12 are exclusively animal-source foods, of which, in
Bangladesh, fish is the most significant, increased consumption of
fish is likely to be an appropriate food-based strategy to prevent
and fight vitamin B12 deficiency.

3.3.3. Vitamin D

Vitamin D3 was undetected in five species and ranged up to
34 wg/100 g (n= 49). Very limited data on vitamin D in fish and
seafood are available for comparison in the literature. The range
reported here is greater than the range of Vitamin D3 in Australian
fish and seafood at 0-20 jzg/100 g (FSANZ, 2010), and similar to the
range of vitamin D3 reported for selected fish and seafood in the
United States at 0-33 jzg/100 g (Byrdwell et al., 2013). Considering
that the RNI of total vitamin D is 5 g/day for PLW and infants, it is
likely that several species could contribute significantly to dietary
vitamin D intakes. Although the same analytical methods were
used, comparisons between species of low vitamin D3 content

(<0.1 j2g/100 g) analysed in different laboratories should be made
with caution due to differences in the LOQ in analysis by the two
laboratories. For example, 14 species were identified with
concentrations of vitamin D3 by analysis at DTU which would
not have returned detectable concentrations by analysis at
AsureQuality (LOQ of 0.05 jg/100 g at DTU compared to 0.5 pg/
100 g at AsureQuality). Of the species analysed for vitamin D2
(n=20) only five species were found to have detectable
concentrations ranging from 0.39 to 2.9 g/100 g. Vitamin D2 is
however, generally only considered to be found in plant-source
foods, specifically yeasts and fungi. There is evidence, however,
that it is found in microalgae and zooplankton, and if this forms
part of the diet of fish, may account for its presence (Rao and
Raghuramulu, 1996). No species were found to have detectable
concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (n = 29). This is the first
time that vitamin D content in fish in Bangladesh has been
evaluated. The data presented here indicate that some species may
contribute significantly to dietary vitamin D intakes in Bangladesh
and it is recommended that further analysis of both vitamin D2 and
D3, using standard analytical methods be conducted.

3.3.4. Vitamin E

Vitamin E in the form of a-tocopherol, 5-tocopherol and y-
tocopherol was analysed in 20 species at AsureQuality. The form of
vitamin E with highest biological activity, a-tocopherol, was
analysed in an additional 25 species at DTU (Table 6). Across all 45
species, «-tocopherol was undetected in four species and ranged
up to 1.9 mg/100 g. Very limited data on a-tocopherol in fish and
seafood are available for comparison in the literature. In the
Australian food composition database, a-tocopherol content of fish
and seafood ranges from 0.1 to 4.2 wg/100g which is broadly
consistent with results reported here (FSANZ, 2010). It is worth
pointing out, however, that although the same method of analysis
was used by the two laboratories, differences in the LOQ mean that
samples tested at AsureQuality were less likely to return detectable
concentrations of w-tocopherol compared to those tested at DTU
(LOQ of 0.07 and 0.02 mg/100g at AsureQuality and DTU,
respectively). No species analysed for other vitamin E components
were found to have detectable concentrations of 5-tocopherol and
only two species were found to have detectable concentrations of
yy-tocopherol which were Tara Baim and Shing with 0.01 and
0.04 IU/100 g, respectively (0.007 and 0.03 mg/100 g, respective-
ly). This is the first time the vitamin E content of fish species in
Bangladesh has been analysed. Considering that the daily RNI for
infants ranges from 2.7 to 5.0 mg a-tocopherol equivalents/day,
(no recommendation for PLW), the data presented here indicate
that some fish are a potentially important source of vitamin E,
particularly in the form of a-tocopherol and it is therefore
recommended that further analysis, using standard methods be
conducted.

3.3.5. Folate

Folate content was analysed in 49 species and is shown in
Table 6. Folate content was below detectable limits in 17 species
and ranged up to 18 wg/100g, consistent with results reported
elsewhere (FSANZ, 2010). Comparisons between species of low
folate content (<8 j1g/100g) analysed in different laboratories
should be made with caution due to differences in analytical
methods and LOQs (LOQ of 8 and 0.2 jrg/100 g at AsureQuality and
DTU, respectively). For example, 20 species were identified by
analysis at DTU with concentrations of folate that would not have
returned detectable concentrations had they been analysed at
AsureQuality. This is the first time folate has been analysed in fish
species in Bangladesh. Considering that the RNI for PLW ranges
from 500 to 600 yg dietary folate equivalents (DFE)/day and for
infants, 80-150 wg DFE/day, the results indicate that all species

analysed would generally be considered low dietary sources of
folate, and therefore unlikely to contribute significantly to dietary
folate intake in Bangladesh.

3.4, Fatty acid composition

All samples with a total fat content of >6 g/100 g were analysed
further for composition of 38 fatty acids and the results are shown
in Table 7 (in addition to juvenile Thai Pangas which had a total fat
content of 1.4g/100g but was analysed for the purpose of
comparison with its adult counterpart). Although it is recognised
that fish species with fat content <6 g/100 g may well be good
sources of fatty acids, due to resource constraints in this study,
species with higher total fat content were prioritised for analyses.
Total PUFA, monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) and saturated
fatty acid (SFA) contents ranged from 0.5 to 3.6 g/100 g, 0.4-7.7 g/
100g and 0.5-8.9g/100g, respectively. Ilish was the most
significant source of PUFA and SFA, whereas Thai Pangas was

Table 7
Fatty acid composition of fish species.

the most significant source of MUFA. The total n-3 PUFA content
ranged from 211 to 2034mg/100g, with the most significant
sources being Ilish and Parse. Total n-6 PUFA content ranged from
178 to 2157 mg/100 g, with the most significant sources being Thai
Pangas and Jat Punti. The ratio of n-6:n-3 PUFA was highest in Thai
Pangas, which is also the only farmed and omnivorous fish
analysed here (except for its juvenile counterpart). This may reflect
differences in the diet and or environmental conditions of farmed
versus capture fish among other factors (Li et al., 2011), although
this would require further investigation. A more balanced n-6:n-3
PUFA ratio is more desirable in prevention of cardiovascular and
other chronic diseases (Simopoulos, 2008), however this evidence
relates to higher disease risk with low n-3 intake, rather than high
n-6 intake or a high n-6:n-3 PUFA ratio and as such, no dietary
recommendation for such a ratio exists (FAO, 2010). The
percentage contribution to daily average nutrient requirement
of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) for PLW and infants (7-23 months)
from a standard portion of fish is shown in Fig. 2, and clearly

Potential contribution to daily DHA requirement (%)

Fig. 2. Potential contribution to daily nutrient requirement? of docosahexaenoic acid
(DHA) from a standard serve? of fish for PLW¢ and infants (7-23 months).

(a) Daily average nutrient requirement of DHA for PLW is 200 mg/day and the
adequate intake for infants is 10-12 mg/kg/day (FAO, 2010). For infants an average
figure of 110 mg/day is used. This was calculated by taking the midpoint within the
maximum range of adequate intakes throughout the age period (10 mg/kg/day fora7
month old of 7.6 kg and 12 mg/kg/day for a 23 month old of 12.0 kg) where weight is
estimated at the 50th percentile according to WHO growth standards (WHO, 2006).
(b) Standard serve of fish for PLW is 50 g/day and for infants is 25 g/day.

(c) PLW, pregnant and lactating women.

demonstrates that all species, except adult and juvenile Thai
Pangas would contribute >20% of daily requirements of DHA for
both PLW and infants. This is of particular interest given the
growing body of literature on the role of fatty acids in growth and
development during the first 1000 days, and specifically, the role of
DHA in normal retinal and brain development (FAO, 2010). The
data presented here indicate that important fish species in
Bangladesh, particularly indigenous species are a good dietary
source of fatty acids and should be considered in food-based
approaches to optimise growth and development during the first
1000 days. It is also recommended that the fatty acid composition
of further species be analysed.

3.5. Species size, edible parts and biodiversity

When making comparisons between species on their overal
nutritional value, it is important to consider the size of the fish, and
implications for what is typically considered ‘edible’ parts. SIS are
typically consumed whole with head, bones and in some cases,
viscera, in stark contrast to large species, where edible parts
typically include body tissue only. The nutritional consequences o!
this can be seen when anatomical components of fish are analysed
separately. For example, in Mola, the eyes and viscera have an
extremely high concentration of vitamin A compared to the body
tissue (Roos et al., 2002). Although separate anatomical parts have
not been analysed here, this trend can be seen when considering
the edible parts of SIS compared to that of large indigenous and
aquaculture species (Table 1), and potential contributions to RNIs
(Table 5). When considering iron, zinc, calcium, vitamin A and
vitamin B12 requirements, there are seven species that would
contribute to >25% of RNI for PLW and six species that would
contribute to >25% of RNI for infants, for three or more
micronutrients simultaneously, when consumed in a 50g or
25g portion, respectively. These species are all SIS (except for
Najara Icha which is a prawn) and edible parts include head and
bones. This underlines the importance of considering typica
consumption patterns, often related to size of the individual fish,
shrimp or prawn, in design of programmes that aim to influence
production and or consumption of fish. One promising example o:
this, now gaining momentum, is the inclusion of nutrient-rich

Mola in pond polyculture systems with carps, which is being
promoted throughout rural Bangladesh (Thilsted and Wahab,
2014b,c).

Table 5 also calls attention to the variation in potential nutrient
contributions of different species. For example, some species
contribute significantly to iron and calcium RNIs and less so to
vitamin A, whereas, others contribute more to zinc and vitamin A
RNIs and less so to iron RNIs. No single species is of resounding
superior nutritional value than any other single species, across all
nutrients, which emphasises the importance of biodiversity in fish
consumption for meeting population nutrient needs.

3.6. Limitations

Nutrient composition of foods, including fish, is known to vary
seasonally, depending on the stage of the life cycle, food availability,
and changes in the wider environment. It was however, outside the
scope of this study to attempt to sample to account for these
variations. Furthermore, a relatively small size of pooled samples
was used, and in the case of analysis of fatty acids, the use of single
replicates. In the local context and considering resource constraints,
it was also not possible to obtain larger more representative sample
sizes. Another limitation of this study is the use of different methods
for analysis of vitamin B12 and folate between species analysed by
different laboratories, although the methods are generally consid-
ered similar (Indyk and Woollard, 2013; Indyke et al., 2002).
Therefore, while it is recognised that these are limitations of the
study, given the lack of existing data on nutrient composition of fish
species in Bangladesh, the results are still of significant value,
providing time and location specific estimates for comparison with
future analyses.

4. Conclusions

Several species have been identified that would contribute
significantly to the RNIs of multiple nutrients of public health
significance. When considering the role of fish in food and nutrition
security in recent decades, research, funding and interventions
have largely focused on the development of aquaculture,
particularly of large carps and introduced species, with an assumed
benefit for nutrition-related outcomes, although this linkage is
dubious. The data presented here show that from a nutritional
perspective, species from inland capture fisheries, particularly
small indigenous species (SIS), hold the potential to provide a
much greater contribution to micronutrient intakes of vulnerable
groups in the population compared to common aquaculture
species. This is likely partially due to the way in which small fish
are consumed, namely, whole with head and bones. Further still,
given the large range in nutrient composition of the different
species reported here, diversity in fish consumption, particularly of
SIS, is likely to promote a more all-inclusive nutrient intake. This
supports the compelling argument that to effectively target
malnutrition, resources should be directed towards ensuring a
more balanced approach of both sustainable capture fisheries
management and aquaculture, including the development of
innovative aquaculture technologies which include nutrient-rich
species, in particular SIS. This paper significantly expands the
current knowledge on the nutritional value of the large diversity of
fish species in Bangladesh, and demonstrates that many species,
particularly SIS and those from inland capture fisheries, have the
potential to contribute significantly to RNIs for a variety of
nutrients. In future studies, it would be useful to determine the
real contribution of different species to nutrient intakes of
vulnerable groups based on consumption, to better inform
programmes targeting improved access, availability and consump-
tion of nutritious foods.
